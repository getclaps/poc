# Proof of Clap

A tiny proof of work library for use in @getclap/button.

This is to prevent low-effort (and only low-effort) attacks from sending an arbitrary amount of claps via constructed/replayed HTTP requests.

However, it is not effective against a dedicated attacker with a bit of GPU time to spare.
